# Techno_Farm
A farmer friendly bot to solve the problems of the farmers with machine learning

## What is Technofarm ?

We have found that many farmers in india face the problem of getting accurate insights about their crop. Farmers try to make their best guess for predicting but they are not right for most of the times. For solving this issue we have come up with an autonomous bot which could move on the field and make predictions for the crop below.
